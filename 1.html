  <p style="margin-top:60px;"><strong>The New York <u>Mets</u></strong> are a Major League Baseball team based
  in the New York City borough of Queens. They compete in Major League Baseball
 (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East division. They are one
  of two MLB teams based in New York City, the other being <a href="https://www.
mlb.com/yankees" target="_blank" title="https://www.mlb.com/yankees">the New York Yankees</a>
  of the American League (AL).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:40px;">One of baseball's first expansion teams,
  the Mets were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the
  Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. The team's colors combine the
  Dodgers' blue and the Giants' orange. For the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets
  played home games at the Polo Grounds. From 1964 to 2008, their home
  ballpark was Shea Stadium. In 2009, they moved into their current ballpark,
  Citi Field.</p>
  <p>The Mets qualified to play in the MLB postseason in 1988 and 2006, coming
     within one game of the World Series both years. After near-misses in 2007
     and 2008, the team made the playoffs in 2015 for the first time in nine years,
     and won their first NL pennant in 15 years. The team again returned to the
     playoffs in 2016, this time with a wild card berth. This was the team's second
     back-to-back playoff appearance, the first occurring during the 1999 and 2000 seasons.</p>
