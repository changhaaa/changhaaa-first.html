    <h1>Description</h1>
    One of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball" target="_blank">baseball</a>'s first expansion teams,
    the Mets were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the
    Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. The team's colors combine the
    Dodgers' blue and the Giants' orange. For the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets
    played home games at the Polo Grounds. From 1964 to 2008, their home
    ballpark was Shea Stadium. In 2009, they moved into their current ballpark,
    Citi Field.
